## 1. Supervised Learning Algorithms

### Linear Regression
- **Description:** Linear regression is a simple algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables.
- **Applications:** Predicting sales, stock prices, temperature, etc.

### Decision Trees
- **Description:** Decision trees recursively split data based on features to make predictions. They are the building blocks of random forests.
- **Applications:** Classification and regression tasks.

### Random Forest
- **Description:** Random forests are ensembles of decision trees. They provide improved predictive performance and reduce overfitting.
- **Applications:** Classification and regression tasks, anomaly detection.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Description:** SVMs find the optimal hyperplane to separate classes in high-dimensional space.
- **Applications:** Classification, regression, face recognition.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Description:** KNN makes predictions based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
- **Applications:** Classification, regression, recommendation systems.

## 2. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

### K-Means Clustering
- **Description:** K-Means groups data points into k clusters based on similarity.
- **Applications:** Image segmentation, customer segmentation.

### Hierarchical Clustering
- **Description:** Hierarchical clustering creates a tree-like structure of clusters.
- **Applications:** Taxonomy creation, community detection.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Description:** PCA reduces dimensionality by transforming data into a new coordinate system.
- **Applications:** Feature reduction, noise reduction.

### Association Rule Learning
- **Description:** Association rule learning discovers interesting relationships between variables in large datasets.
- **Applications:** Market basket analysis, recommendation systems.

## 3. Reinforcement Learning

### Q-Learning
- **Description:** Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to learn a policy, which tells an agent what action to take under what circumstances.
- **Applications:** Game playing, robotics.

### Deep Q Networks (DQN)
- **Description:** DQN combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks for more complex problems.
- **Applications:** Game playing, robotic control.

## 4. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Word Embeddings
- **Description:** Word embeddings map words to high-dimensional vectors, capturing semantic relationships.
- **Applications:** Sentiment analysis, named entity recognition.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- **Description:** RNNs are designed for sequential data, allowing information to be passed between steps.
- **Applications:** Language modeling, machine translation.
